API Reference
===============

WhaPy
-------

WhaPy is a Python API for whatsapp. WhaPy listens to events from the app and dispatch them into beautiful coroutines.


Moreover, WhaPy module provides classes for managing whatsapp chats and messages.

.. autoclass:: WhaPy
    :members:

Event Reference
---------------

This page outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`WhaPy`.

This is an example of how to register an event: ::

    from WhaPy import WhaPy

    @asyncio.coroutine
    async def on_message(chat, messages):
        for i in range(0,len(messages)):
        if not messages[i].is_media():
            print(messages[i].get_content())
            if messages[i].get_content() == "@who":
                chat.send_message("are you?")

.. warning::

    All the events must be a |corourl|_. If they aren't, then you might get unexpected
    errors. In order to turn a function into a coroutine they must either be decorated
    with ``@asyncio.coroutine`` or in Python 3.5+ be defined using the ``async def``
    declaration.

    The following two functions are examples of coroutine functions: ::

        async def on_ready():
            pass

        @asyncio.coroutine
        def on_ready():
            pass

.. function:: on_ready()

    Triggered after scanning QR Code and whatsapp page is ready. Chats and messages are filled up.

.. function:: on_message(chat, messages)

    Triggered each time unread messages are detected. 

    :param chat: A :class:`Chat` of the chat which fired the event.
    :param messages: An array of :class:`Message`.


Enumeration
-------------

The API provides a enumeration for browser selection.

All enumerations are subclasses of `enum`_.

.. _enum: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html

.. class:: Browser

    Specifies the browser application will execute on.
